RimSynapse Psychology registers two advanced **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** tools with the Core engine. These endpoints expose the colonist's traits, sanity thresholds, social networks, and interaction history directly to the AI Storyteller and dialogue handlers.

Below is the list of Psychology MCP endpoints, along with **plain English instructions** you can use to query them.
