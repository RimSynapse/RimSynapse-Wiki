# Cloud LLM Setup Guide

RimSynapse Core provides seamless integrations with three of the most powerful frontier model providers: **OpenAI**, **Google Gemini**, and **Anthropic Claude**. It also includes a completely free, built-in image provider (**Pollinations.ai**) that requires no setup whatsoever!

This guide will walk you through how to generate the API keys necessary to enable the frontier text and vision models.

## 🎨 Free Image Generation (No Setup Required!)

Before diving into API keys, you should know that RimSynapse Core already has a fully integrated, open, and free image generation provider: **Pollinations.ai**. 
- **Cost**: 100% Free
- **API Key**: None required! 
- **Setup**: None! It is hardwired into the Core and is ready to generate pictures for your Factions and World News events the moment you install the mod.

## 1. OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4-Turbo)

OpenAI provides industry-leading reasoning, vision, and text generation. It operates on a **Pay-As-You-Go** model. You must load your account with at least $5.00 in credits to use the API.

## 3. Anthropic Claude (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet is arguably the best overall model for RimSynapse right now, balancing high-speed responses with top-tier intelligence. **Anthropic uses a Pay-As-You-Go model**, meaning you will need to add a small amount of billing credits to use the API. 

### Steps to Generate an API Key:
1. Navigate to the [Anthropic API Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
2. Log in with your email or Google account.
3. If this is your first time, you may need to verify a phone number and add a minimum balance of $5 to your billing account.
4. Click the black **Create key** button in the top right.
5. Name your key something recognizable like "RimSynapse" and click Create.

![Copy Anthropic Key](file:///C:/Users/sealt/.gemini/antigravity-ide/brain/9d9ad06c-a8dd-4ffe-a841-64ad74dcf29d/claude_api_keys_1783868238832_redacted.png)

6. Copy the generated API key immediately (it starts with `sk-ant-`).
7. Paste this key into the **Anthropic Claude Key** field in the RimSynapse Provider Settings window.

### Security Reminder
**Never share your API keys.** If you accidentally paste your API key in a public Discord server or GitHub issue, the provider will automatically detect it, revoke the key, and you will have to generate a new one.
