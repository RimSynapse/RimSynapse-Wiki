# MCP Tool-Calling Endpoints (Plain English Queries)

RimSynapse Core implements a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** tool-calling engine. When you chat with your colonists, or when the AI Storyteller evaluates the colony, the LLM does not need to guess or hoard pre-calculated data. Instead, it dynamically queries the game state using registered tools.

Below is the list of all MCP endpoints currently registered in Core, along with **plain English instructions** you can use to prompt the LLM to invoke them.

## 1. Environment and Resource Queries

### `get_stockpile_details`
- **What it does**: Scans all stockpiles on the map and returns exact quantities of raw materials (steel, wood, components, silver, medicine, and food nutrition).
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Check what resources we have in the stockpiles."*
  - *"Do we have enough food and medicine for winter?"*
  - *"List our current steel and component counts."*

### `get_map_environment`
- **What it does**: Returns the biome, current outdoor temperature, weather, overhead mountain cave cells count, geothermal steam vents count, active Comms Console gateway status, and a list of all turrets, doors, and generators (detailing load IDs, coordinates, and active hack/cooldown status).
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Tell me about the map environment."*
  - *"Are there any geothermal vents or overhead mountain areas on our map?"*
  - *"Scan the map electronics and list all active turrets, doors, and power generators."*

## 2. Pawn Status Queries

### `get_colonists_profile`
- **What it does**: Returns a summary profile of all colonists, detailing their names, shooting/melee skills, traits, active weapons, and visible health/injury conditions.
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Who are the colonists, and what are their primary traits?"*
  - *"Who is our best shooter, and what weapons are they holding?"*
  - *"List any colonists who are currently bleeding or injured."*

### `get_colony_moods`
- **What it does**: Scans the colony and lists mood percentages, mental break thresholds (Minor, Major, Extreme risk alerts), and active negative thoughts for all colonists.
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"How is everyone feeling right now?"*
  - *"Who is at risk of snapping, and what is bothering them?"*
  - *"Check if anyone has extremely low mood or traumatic thoughts."*

## 3. Threat and Incident Controls

### `get_active_threats`
- **What it does**: Counts active hostiles (raiders, mechanoids, mad animals), bug hives, crashed ship parts, and fires on the map.
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Are there any active threats or fires on the map?"*
  - *"Scan the area for hostile raiders or mechanoids."*

### `get_available_incidents` / `fire_incident`
- **What it does**: Lists all available storyteller events and their base weights, along with modder-supplied thematic descriptions. `fire_incident` triggers the selected incident immediately (e.g. raids, cargo pods, infestations).
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"What storytelling events are available to fire?"*
  - *"Trigger a mechanoid raid on the colony."*
  - *"Spawn some cargo pods near the base."*

## 4. Colonist Possession & Breakdowns

### `possess_colonist`
- **What it does**: Directs a colonist to perform a specific action (move, attack, draft, undraft) and locks out player manual overrides. Control is automatically released on condition triggers (Damage, Downed, ExtremeMood, Hunger, Exhaustion, Bleeding, EnemyNearby, TargetReached, or Timer).
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Possess John and force him to draft and walk to the geyser at (12, 45). Release him if he takes damage."*
  - *"Order Sarah to attack the hostiles. Keep her possessed until the enemy is nearby or she gets downed."*

### `trigger_colonist_break`
- **What it does**: Invokes a context-stripped secondary LLM solver to resolve a colonist's breakdown (suicide, homicide, crisis of faith, or map-edge departure) without triggering LLM safety filters.
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Initiate a dynamic breakdown on John due to his grief."*
  - *"Force a crisis of faith breakdown on Sarah to test her beliefs."*

## 5. Electronic Sabotage and Remote Hacking

### `control_turret`
- **What it does**: Intercepts a map turret to toggle power states, redirect targeting to attack friendly colonists (if sabotaged), or trigger a self-destruct detonation.
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Shutdown Turret_MiniTurret123."*
  - *"Target the autocannon turret to fire at John."*
  - *"Activate the self-destruct sequence and detonate the heavy turret at (15, 80)!"*

### `attempt_remote_hack`
- **What it does**: Remotely breaches a target electronic object's firewall (turret, power generator, or door). Requires a powered Comms Console and a nearby Hacker Base within 8 world map tiles. Hacked turrets target friendlies for 5m; hacked generators shut down for 1h; hacked doors lock shut for 1h. Starts a 4h reboot cooldown.
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Attempt a remote hack on the solar generator to shut down power."*
  - *"Breach the local firewall of Door_Autodoor456 to lock it shut."*
  - *"Remotely compromise the autocannon turret."*

### `spawn_hacker_base`
- **What it does**: Spawns an enemy transceiver outpost within 8 tiles of the colony on the world map. This base acts as the network uplink allowing remote hacks to be broadcast against your colony's defense grid.
- **Plain English Prompt Examples**:
  - *"Set up a remote hacking transceiver base nearby on the world map."*
  - *"Spawn the Hacker Base quest site within 8 tiles."*
